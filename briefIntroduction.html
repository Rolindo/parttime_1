					<p>Hi my name is joshua and currently I’m 19 years of age. I have a nice personality and am very easy to get along
						with. This is my first semester of college like a lot of other people. My major in Hudson county community
						college
						is computer science because I just love technology and how it works. What I like to do in my spare time is to
						play
						video games and just relax with friends and family. People may see that as somewhat weird to play video games as
						a
						hobby, but it’s what I really like to do. I’m also what experts that study personality call an introvert.
						Introverts usually like to enjoy something on their own and like their personal space. It’s not that they are
						lonely or anything, it’s just that social gatherings tire them out quickly. That happens to me a lot so I don’t
						really like social stuff that much. I prefer to enjoy things at my own pace. This whole blogging thing is new to
						me and I really like it. It could probably make me new friends and people that have common interests with me.
